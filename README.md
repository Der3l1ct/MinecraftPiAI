# MinecraftPiAI
A deep learning AI for Minecraft pi edition

Imports:
gym: OpenAI's toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms.
spaces: Part of the gym library, used to define action and observation spaces.
mcpi.minecraft: An API to interact with Minecraft.
keras: A high-level neural networks API, running on top of TensorFlow.
numpy: A fundamental package for scientific computing in Python.

Minecraft Environment:
MinecraftEnv: A custom gym environment for Minecraft. Specifics of the environment such as how states are represented, the reward structure, and possible actions have been omitted (as indicated by the comment # ... [all methods and initializations for MinecraftEnv]).
Q-Network Model Definition:env = MinecraftEnv(): Instantiate the Minecraft environment.The neural network model (model) takes a 10x10x10 input (presumably a voxel grid or some representation of the Minecraft world) and has two layers: a dense layer with 128 neurons and ReLU activation, and an output layer with a number of neurons equal to the number of possible actions in the environment.The optimizer used is Adam with a learning rate of 0.001, and the loss function is Mean Squared Error, common choices for DQN.
Parameters:
epsilon: Used for the ε-greedy action selection method. It represents the probability of taking a random action versus exploiting the best-known action.
epsilon_decay: After each episode, epsilon will be multiplied by this decay rate, causing the agent to explore less over time and exploit its knowledge more.
gamma: The discount factor used in the Q-learning update equation. It determines the present value of future rewards.Helper 
Functions for DQN:
choose_action: Determines the action the agent should take, given a state. It uses the ε-greedy method.
learn: Updates the Q-values based on the given state, action, reward, next state, and done flag (indicating if the episode has ended). This function would include the Q-learning update step and backpropagation to update the neural network.
DQN Training Loop:The agent is trained over a certain number of episodes. Within each episode, the agent interacts with the environment, selects actions, receives rewards, and updates its Q-values. The exact code for the training loop has been omitted.
Close the Environment:
env.close(): Close the Minecraft environment.

A complete DQN for Minecraft would need several components not provided here, such as:The actual representation of the state from Minecraft.The specific actions the agent can perform.How rewards are determined.Implementation details for the choose_action and learn functions.Handling of memory (experience replay) which is often crucial for stable learning in DQN.
